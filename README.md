**What do you notice in the visualization?**

I like the simplicity of the visualization. It's very clean. I like the story and the animation.

The colours of the subprime and acceptable lines are a little too close - I find them difficult to tell apart.

A refresh/replay button would be helpful as I'd like to review the data

**What questions do you have about the data?**

Until I Googled what Prosper was, I couldn't understand the context of the data completely.   I could obviously see the differences and relationships in the data. The data made more sense when I knew Prosper was a lending company.

**What relationships do you notice?**

There wasn't a large difference in the number of loans given by credit score prior to Q4 2009. After Q4 2009, lending for Excellent, Good and Acceptable are similar until Q3 2013 when it seems those with Excellent credit scores stopped asking for more debt while those that were Good and Acceptable continued to rise.

**What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?**

The amount of debt is terrifying. Those with Sub Prime credit scores stopped getting credit only for everyone else to start borrowing way more than before. It won't be those with current sub prime credit scores that cause the next financial crisis.

**Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?**

No
